About this Project
In this project, you'll use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, you'll add your own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
Instead of plain "vanilla" JavaScript, you'll use the popular jQuery library to complete this project. While it's important for a developer to have a solid understanding and familiarity of plain vanilla JavaScript, it's also important to be able to understand and work with jQuery since it is so common and prevalent on the web.

The benefits of using jQuery are:

Shorter and simplified syntax
Help with cross-browser compatibility since jQuery deals with a lot of that stuff under the hood
A strong familiarity with jQuery will only make you a better developer since it enjoys a strong market share on the web
